Introduction
------------


	The Do_SPDX project looks to extract the spdx generation from the yocto project into an object oriented, flexible, and configurable module in python. The project looks to achieve this through a sleek command line interface, configurable database caching, and implementing the do_spdx functionality in a Python class.
